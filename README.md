#### Builder Pattern in C#

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This is particularly useful when dealing with objects that have many optional parameters or configurations. Â  

#### Key Components:

- Product: The complex object being constructed.
- Builder: An abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object.
- Concrete Builder: Implements the Builder interface to construct and assemble parts of the Product.
- Director (Optional): Constructs an object using the Builder interface.
- Real-World Examples and Problems:

#### Building a Computer Configuration:

- Problem: Configuring a computer involves numerous components (CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, etc.), each with various options. Creating a constructor with all possible combinations would be cumbersome and lead to a "telescoping constructor" problem.
- Solution: Use a Builder pattern.
- Product: Computer class.
- Builder: ComputerBuilder interface/abstract class with methods like AddCPU(), AddRAM(), AddStorage(), etc.
- Concrete Builders: GamingComputerBuilder, OfficeComputerBuilder, each configuring the computer differently.
- Director (Optional): A ComputerAssembler class that takes a ComputerBuilder and calls the appropriate methods to build a specific computer configuration.
